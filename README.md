# Discord-audit-log-ESM
I have written the initial code. The way you have to do this is just sit back and read the JSON changes and you'll be able to use them. For sending method, use Discord API. This code is without Discord.js, just WebSocket.

## system requirements
- NodeJS 8.9.0 ( --experimental-modules ) or higher version | `Recommended version 13.2.0`
- Type Module : ES Modules
